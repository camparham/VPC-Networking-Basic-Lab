# VPC-Networking-Basic-Lab

### Goal
Configure a custom VPC to practice secure, fault-tolerant cloud networking principles used in enterprise enviornments. 

### Value
Network provisioning may seem tedious and daunting, but this meta-step process is critical for architecture operating in secure and isolated environments. It enables traffic features to work together to launch AWS services that require a VPC (e.g., Lambda, SageMaker Studio, EKS), as well as troubleshoot functioning and deployment issues for AWS services. 
Designed and deployed a custom Amazon VPC from scratch to demonstrate fundamental Cloud networking principles.

## Tasks completed
Design and deploy a custom Amazon VPC from scratch using **CloudWatch**, **subnets**, **route tables**, **IGW**, and **security groups**
*   Created a custom VPC with multiple private and public subnets across two AZs
*   Configured route tables, internet gateway, and a NAT gateway to allow public access
*   Aplied security groups and **NACLs** to control inbound and outbound traffic
*   Deployed **EC2** instances into seperate AZs
*   Validated connectivity between instances to simulate real-world tiered architecture

## Impact 
*   Improved understanding of AWS networking best practices
*   Retained how to manage secure multi-tier architectures in production
*   Reinforced cost-effcient design principles
*   Designed an architecture in AWS SageMaker to streamline code deployment and automate end-to-end ML lifecycle management.
